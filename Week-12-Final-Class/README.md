#### LOANER LAPTOPS:  If your whole team has no laptop and no way to present:
* DM Jackie Belladano for a loaner laptop. 
* Pick up on Monday 12/1 between 1:30-5:00pm. 
* CUNY Grad School office at 365 5th Ave, New York, NY 10016 Room 4110. 
* We only have Mac's. You are responsible for installing whatever you need to on that computer. They are bascially blank slates.

#### REDUNDANCY aka BACKUP PLAN
Everyone bring their laptops and be able to run the project locally and on the website because something always goes wrong with some laptop.
