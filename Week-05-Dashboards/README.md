# Homework
### 1. TEAM BASED - Create a Project Design Doc
0. You have to decide on a project idea.  It can change, but you need something to start with.  
0. Create a document that outlines everything you are doing.  Be sure to include everything you can think of in an organized manner. Things like...
    * Overall Concept
    * Each member and tasks / roles they are responsible for.
    * Challenges, Solutions, Risks, Implementation
    * Anything else you can think of that will help you 

0. Paste the link to that document in the [Project Tracker Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x_UyRUQoe7MhY0KeHdt0ticF8Pdw18xyY8iW82rmasg/edit?usp=sharing) in the **Link to Project Design Document** column. 

0. Here are two examples of current students great project design docs:

### 2. TEAM BASED - Exercise
0. Create a [Github Team/Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team).  With your project team members. 
1. In your team org, create a repo.   
0. Build a dashboard about ANYTHING with any of the three frame works (flask, dash, or streamlit).
    * I suggest using the data you are using for your project.
    * However, you can use the data provided (`data/baseball.csv`), or ANY data you would like. 
2. Make at least 2 charts.  And explain why you made them and why they are important.   
4. Impress me.
