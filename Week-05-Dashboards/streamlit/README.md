# Building Web Apps with [Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io/) 

You need to install a new library...
* `pip install streamlit`


### Set up a virtual environment to test your app out locally.
Navigate to the folder you want to build your app in. Then run the following.  

**Very important...**, when you are adding these code files to your github repo, **do not add the env folder at all**.  This is for local use only and will only slow down everything. 

```
mkdir env

python3 -m venv env/

source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
