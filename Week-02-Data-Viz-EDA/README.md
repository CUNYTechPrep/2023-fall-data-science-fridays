## How to make us better
I am crowd sourceing yall for your feedback to make my lectures better. Better lectures.  Better experiences! This is called iterative learning and is an importnat concept in Data Science.  

* Pay it forward -- make it better for the kids next year.  Makes you feel good. 
* Doing this will make __YOU__ smarter. You get to talk in depth about stuff with me (blush emoji).
* We are a Non-Profit, its like donating to charty with your mind brain smarts. 

### Rules about the improving-letures document. 
Same CTP behavioral rules apply.  TLDR; Any non professional behavior will be elminated from the document and make me sad. 
[Here is the doc where you can add things improvements.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iFKxDgfehz3Xq7sWslpqpU9ATcTfKifZbEZsO0j-1Tw/edit#heading=h.qvjwlvg9nykl)

## How to update your fork with this weeks new lecture files.
0. Run this again for safety measures.
	* IF YOU ARE IN __TUESDAYS__ CLASS:  
		* `git remote add upstream https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/2023-fall-data-science-tuesday`
	* IF YOU ARE IN __FRDIAYS__ CLASS: 
		* `git remote add upstream https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/2023-fall-data-science-fridays`
	* If it says `fatal: remote upstream already exists.` That is GOOD and means you listened the first time and already added the upstream.
0. Fetch the new files
	* `git fetch upstream` 
0. Merge/download the newly added files.
	*  `git merge upstream/main`
	* If a crazy screen comes up that looks like this, just hit `:q` then enter to close it and you should be fine.  [image here]![enter image description here](https://github.com/zd123/images-for-class/blob/main/forking-image-instructions/98-strange-screen.png?raw=true). Just hit `:q` then enter on your keyboard.  It should close that window. 
0. Push the new downloaded files into your repo. 
	* `git push`

## Sanity check
0. Open your forked repo on the internet
0. Make sure you can see the new weeks files in there. 


## REVIEW:  Adding your changes to github and pushing them to the internet
0. In your terminal that is in repo where you just edited the Exercise file....
0. Add your changes 
	* `git add [THE NAME OF THE FILE YOU EDITED]`
0. Commit your changes
	* `git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE'`
0. Push your changes
	* `git push`


## Sanity check
0. Open your forked repo on the internet
0. Go to the file you edited.  
0. Make sure you can see the edits you made. 
0. If you cannot, in your terminal, type in `git status` and google the error or ask in slack or come to office hours. 


# Homework For Next Week

### Next Week's Pre-Class Work
0. Watch this AMAZING video about how to [how to tell if your model is good or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdsp6soqA7o&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer).
0. Watch this brief overview of [what IS machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU) (~8 mins)
1. Watch [this NOVA documentary](https://youtu.be/4svcCJJ6ciw?si=ERSmoLJOEhIAKVqp) that got me into data science. (~50 mins) This is optional but highly suggested and very well made and fun to watch.  If you are pressed for time, you can start at the 18 min mark, which will make it only ~30min. 

### Complete the Exercise-DONT-EDIT-MAKE-COPY.ipynb
Remember, make a copy of that file.  Add your initials to that copy. `Exercise-XX.ipynb`. Then edit that file, push your changes, and add the link to the HW submission sheet. (link is on main readme and bookmarked in slack channel)
