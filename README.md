## Detailed Instructions For Submitting HWs
You have HW almost every week. HW is due anytime before the next class.  You have pre-class work and post-class work.  

**Post-class HW** Is usually the is `Exercise-DONT-EDIT-MAKE-COPY.ipynb` file.  
1. First make a copy of that file, rename it `Exercise-[YOUR-INITIALS].ipynb`.  
0. Complete the assignment and extra credit if you feel like being extra awesome.    
0. Git add, commit, and push your `Exercise-[YOUR-INITIALS].ipynb` to your github.  
0. Open your github page in your browser.  Navigate to the file you just edited.  Open that file.  Then copy that pages URL and paste it next to your name in your HW Submission sheet under the week it was assigned.  

**Pre-Class HW**  Is usually a reading or video and small exercise.  You don't have to hand in the exercise, rather all you have to do is reply in line to that weeks slack message about this class prework with just one thing you learned, thought was cool, or found interesting _THAT HAS YET TO BE MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS REPLYS_. 
* Replying to the message means hovering over the message and click the ‘reply in thread’ message looking icon and type your response in there.  
* Once you have replied, hover on your message, click the vertical '...' options thing. Then click, "Copy Link".  
* Now paste that link to your message next to your name in the HW Submission sheet in the Week-X-Prework column.


## Extra-Extra Credit
Here is a list of random tasks / problems / ideas that I come across that I cannot fit into the curriculum but are still important.
