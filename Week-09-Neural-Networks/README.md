## Homework due next week 
2. VERY IMPORTANT!! Pre-Class work 
	* Watch [Getting Started with HuggingFace video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaBAZQCtwE&ab_channel=AssemblyAI) [15min]
	* [~1-2hrs] Start the [HuggingFace NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter0/1?fw=pt) by completing the first two sections.  Part 0 and Part 1. I recommend doing the entire course, but that is up to you, however, you MUST DO PART 0 and PART 1.  
		* [Part 0: Setup / Intro](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter0/1?fw=pt)
			* I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOLLOWING ALONG IN google colab, AND NOT TRYING TO INSTALL/RUN LOCALLY.
		* [Part 1. Transformer Models](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1?fw=pt)
			* Complete and record your score of the End-of-chapter quiz
		* If youre having trouble, here are [live coding sessions](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/events/1?fw=pt) that might help.
		* If you do decided to do more, i would focus on section [PART 3: FINE-TUNING A PRETRAINED MODEL](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter3/1?fw=pt).
